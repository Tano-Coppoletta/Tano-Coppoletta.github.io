# Gaetano Coppoletta

Hi, I'm Gaetano Coppoletta, a Software Developer specializing in cybersecurity and AI-powered security automation. I currently work at Oracle in the Global Product Security team, where I build tools to automate vulnerability management processes and improve security intelligence platforms.

## About Me

I'm passionate about cybersecurity research, AI/ML applications in security, and building robust, scalable systems. My work focuses on:

- **Security Automation**: Developing AI tools automate vulnerability management
- **Vulnerability Research**: Discovering and analyzing security vulnerabilities in various systems
- **Product Security**: Contributing to enterprise-level security platforms and tools
- **Research & Development**: Conducting academic research in cybersecurity and publishing findings

## My Research & Projects

### OCPPStorm - Comprehensive Fuzzing Tool
My most significant research project is **OCPPStorm**, a comprehensive black box fuzzing tool for OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) implementations. This project:

- Discovered **6 critical vulnerabilities** leading to CVE assignments
- Employed multiple fuzzing strategies (Random, State Machine, and Isla Fuzzer)
- Improved security of electric vehicle charging infrastructure
- Was published at the **Network and Distributed System Security (VehicleSec) 2024** - NDSS Symposium

## This Website

This is my personal portfolio website - a minimal, professional site with a subtle cybersecurity aesthetic. It's built using:

- **Astro** for static site generation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Custom components** for the terminal-style typewriter effect


## Current Work
